```
Drink up, all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun, you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me
Try to think that love's not around

Order anything you see
Have fun, you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me

Try to think that love's not around
My old heart ain't gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Misspent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up, all you people
Order anything you see
And have fun, you happy people

Pardon me, but I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
Gotta find who's now number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here

Drink up, all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun, you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me

Order anything you see
The drink and the laugh's on me

Try to think that love's not around
Still it's uncomfortably near
My old heart ain't gaining no ground

Angel eyes that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight

Order anything you see
And have fun, you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me

Pardon me, but I gotta run
Gotta find who's now number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here

Excuse me while I disappear

Hey, drink up, all you people
Have fun, you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me

Try to think that love's not around
Still it's uncomfortably near

Hey, drink up, all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun, you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me

Still it's uncomfortably near
Because my angel eyes ain't here
